# Getting started

This fork runs as a self-hosted server: see [Server deployment](server-deployment.md). For running from source, see [Development](development.md).

## Connect models

Open **Settings → Providers** and configure a connection:

- **Provider API keys:** use your own account and pay that provider's rates.
- **Subscription connections:** ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Grok use their respective sign-in flows and account limits. They do not silently fall back to API-key billing.
- **[Claude Code](claude-code.md):** use a separately installed and authenticated CLI. Its own configuration controls routing and billing; this is not a subscription-only guarantee.
- **[Custom endpoint](custom-providers.md):** connect one OpenAI-compatible server, including a local model server. LearnHarness does not install or download models.

Choose **Strong**, **Cheap**, and **Vision** models in Settings. There are no factory model selections. New sessions start with Strong; background roles use their assigned slots or role overrides. A model selected inside an existing session belongs to that session and does not change background-role choices.

Optional web search supports SearXNG (your own instance: set its URL), Tavily, Brave, Exa, Firecrawl, and hosted Ollama search; configure the engine you want to use. Research can still fetch known URLs without a search key. Dictation has its own service key below.

## Start a session

Choose **Teach** and describe what you want to understand. The agent probes your starting point, presents a plan, and teaches through explanations and checks. Reply naturally to accept or revise the plan.

Use the thinking fields to explain your reasoning, uncertainty, or reaction—not only your selected answer. You can type or dictate. Your confidence is self-reported, not an independent assessment.

Choose **Practice** for problems rather than a lesson. Start from selected graph material or describe material directly. Submit your thinking as you work; the model's committed solution is revealed when the problem concludes. Use **Next problem** when ready to continue.

Sessions are saved locally, including earlier messages when context is compacted. The [keyboard guide](keyboard.md) covers submission, focus, question controls, and cancellation.

## Dictation

1. Create a [Deepgram API key](https://console.deepgram.com/) with the **Member role or higher**, required for [short-lived token minting](https://developers.deepgram.com/reference/auth/tokens/grant).
2. Add it under **Settings → Providers → Dictation** and choose the language below the key. **Multilingual** supports automatic recognition and mixed-language speech.
3. Use the microphone or **Mod+D** to start and stop. Review the text before sending. **Esc cancellation discards the pending transcript**; stop normally to keep it.

Audio streams from your browser directly to Deepgram using a short-lived token. A `403 Insufficient permissions` error while obtaining that token can mean the key's role is insufficient.

## Use files in a session

The agent's file tools read only the library folder (`LH_LIBRARY_DIR`); without one there are no file tools and no paperclip. The paperclip uploads files into the library's `uploads/` folder and inserts their paths into the message; you can also type a path inside the library. Paths outside it, the data and credential folders, and `.env` files are refused.

The teacher can show a local raster image or request an annotated visual based on it. Displayed/annotated pictures are saved as session-owned snapshots, so those saved results no longer depend on the original file. This does not snapshot every file attachment. Offline regression tests cover snapshot/payload behavior, not the quality of model-generated annotations.

File tools are read-only. Review what you put in the library: content an agent reads may be sent to its configured model provider. See [file-access boundaries](architecture.md#file-access-and-external-services).

## Extract into the graph

For lessons, attach material to a session instead. Use the graph's **Extract files… → Files** or **Folder** picker for Markdown, plain text, or PDFs. This is a separate import flow, not the session's path attachments. Each supported file is uploaded for processing; folders organize imported sources.

- Files are limited to **25 MiB each**. Imports queue independently, with up to three files in flight.
- PDF conversion is local text extraction, not OCR. Image-only pages are skipped and counted; scanner text can be inaccurate. Check the import's notices.
- Imported text then goes through model-based proposition/chain extraction. Local PDF conversion does not make the whole import offline.
- Completed chunks survive later failures. Retry is explicit and reprocesses the file; unchanged content is not automatically skipped. The file queue does not survive a page reload.

The graph stores propositions and reasoning chains with source provenance, **not mastery scores**. A proposition's presence is not proof that you understood or retained it. Automatic session extraction can be disabled independently of graph rendering.

## Data, privacy, and usage

Chats, graph records, and settings live in `LH_DATA_DIR`; API keys and subscription credentials live in the folder holding `LH_AUTH_FILE` (see [Server deployment](server-deployment.md#environment)).

API-key files sit beside `data`, not inside it. They are plaintext with restrictive file permissions, not an encrypted vault. Keep complete profiles private; do not share credential files or raw debug captures in bug reports.

**Local storage does not mean local-only processing.** Configured models, subscription/CLI services, web research, and dictation can receive content. A local custom model is a separate setup choice, not an offline guarantee for other enabled services.

Click the context/cost row beneath the composer for Session stats. Dollar figures estimate known API costs; subscription, CLI, and custom-endpoint usage are not treated as free. See [context, caching, and costs](compaction-accounting.md) for the details.

Updates: merge an upstream release and rebuild (see [Server deployment](server-deployment.md#pulling-upstream-releases)). There is no in-app updater.
